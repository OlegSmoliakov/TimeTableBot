# TimeTableBot

This project will provide convenient access to Georgia Tech University's schedule via telegram bot.

The schedule is parsed by BeautifulSoup and saved to a Sqlite database or xlsx.

After that the database can be used not only for Telegram API, but also for other messengers with API access.

### Currently:
- Parsing works with one group from the old schedule
- Bot remains in demo version
- The database structure needs to be finalized a bit
