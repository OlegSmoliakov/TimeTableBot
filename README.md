# TimeTableBot 

This project provide convenient access to Georgia Tech University's schedule via telegram bot.

**Note:** This repo was created for demonstration purposes.

The schedule is parsed by BeautifulSoup, sent to my friend's db service, and used to retrieve data for user requests.

## Features:
- Wrote using async libraries aiohttp and aiogram
- Support internalization, using pybable and i18n middleware from aiogram
- Automatically updates schedule data each 12 hours
